We'll fetch elevation data (a Digital Elevation Model) from The National Map for each tile, create  additional derivative products, and write our outputs as GeoTiffs to Google Drive. \n","\n","DEMs will be retrieved from a webservice hosted by The National Map using elevation data produced by the US Geological Survey's [3D Elevation Program](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep/what-is-3dep?). \n","\n","In subsequent processing, we may generate other terrain-derived layers (e.g., slope, aspect, curvature) from these DEMs. For now, we'll just grab the raw DEM and generate a couple layers quantifying Topographic Position Index (TPI). We add TPI layers here because, as described below, the calculation of TPI involves a convolution that requires elevation data that extends beyond the footprint of the tile we will ultimately retain and export to Google Drive. \n","\n","### Topographic Position Index (TPI)\n","TPI characterizes the elevation of a point on the landscape relative to its surroundings. It is calculated as a convolution of a DEM where the size of the kernel used for the convolution can be adjusted to capture local-scale to regional-scale topographic features.  \n","\n","<figure>\n","<img src='http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TY5OYyOA4n7ke-CtGR7LFIdRVpPIG5IX' width=500px>\n","<figcaption align='left'>Illustration of TPI (credit: <a href='http://jennessent.com/arcview/TPI_jen_poster.htm'>Jeff Jenness</a>)</figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","In this notebook, we follow the original description of TPI by [Weiss (2001)](http://www.jennessent.com/downloads/tpi-poster-tnc_18x22.pdf) by using an annular (donut-shaped) kernel that subtracts the average elevation of pixels in the donut from the elevation at the single pixel in the center of the donut hole. We implement TPI calculations at a range of 300m (annulus runs from 150-300m from the center pixel) and for 2000m (annulus runs 1850-2000m)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ttEujycm1D-s"},"source":["# Mount Google Drive \n","So we can access our files showing tile locations, and save the rasters we will generate from the elevation data."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"nIX843deLShB","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1596478913732,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1658,"user":{"displayName":"David Diaz","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjh1OmCKzplbVp1ZPZLYNeFVoDha8mOgjOpP5ISnQ=s64","userId":"05894085007010941086"}},"outputId":"30926509-7f4a-47bc-a068-9f7f6a2a64e1"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wUsNdsi5H2sD"},"source":["! pip install geopandas rasterio -q"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Pc8bz1n8h4tF"},"source":["The following functions will do the work to retrieve the DEM (or calculate a TPI raster from a DEM) from The National Map's web service."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"WhAkNSDeJR_T"},"source":["import io\n","import numpy as np\n","import geopandas as gpd\n","# import richdem as rd\n","import os\n","import rasterio\n","import requests\n","\n","from functools import partial\n","from imageio import imread\n","from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n","from multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool\n","from rasterio import transform\n","from scipy.ndimage.filters import convolve\n","from skimage import filters\n","from skimage.morphology import disk\n","from skimage.transform import resize\n","from skimage.util import apply_parallel\n","\n","\n","def dem_from_tnm(bbox, res, inSR=4326, **kwargs):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Retrieves a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) image from The National Map (TNM)\n","    web service.\n","\n","    Parameters\n","    ----------\n","    bbox : list-like\n","      list of bounding box coordinates (minx, miny, maxx, maxy)\n","    res : numeric\n","      spatial resolution to use for returned DEM (grid cell size)\n","    inSR : int\n","      spatial reference for bounding box, such as an EPSG code (e.g., 4326)\n","\n","    Returns\n","    -------\n","    dem : numpy array\n","      DEM image as array\n","    \"\"\"\n","    width = int(abs(bbox[2] -
